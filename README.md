This project is the Crystal Collector Game.

A random number will be generated at the start of each round. Behind each crystal/question mark icon is a randomly generated number. Each time you click an icon, a number will be added to your score for that round.

Your goal is to increase your score and hit the target number. Win count will go up and a new game will start if you succeed. Otherwise, the losses increase.

Current Project status:
Used question mark instead of crystals.
